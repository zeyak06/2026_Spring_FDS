# Introduction to High Performance Computing

## Acknowedgments 
Thanks to the [Rutgers Office of Advanced Research and Computing (OARC)](https://sites.google.com/view/cluster-user-guide/amarel/welcome?authuser=0), Google, Wikipedia (images), and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) for helping me make these slides!

In addition, some information was obtained from the following online slides [(click here).](https://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/courses/cps343/presentations/History_and_Overview_of_HPC.pdf)

## What is High Performance Computing?

**High Performance Computing (HPC)** is the use of parallel processing for running advanced application programs efficiently, reliably, and quickly. It involves aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance than a typical desktop or workstation.

\vskip .1in

Why High Performance Computing?

- HPC allows users to tackle complex problems that require substantial computational resources.
- It enables simulations, data analysis, and modeling that would be infeasible on standard computers.
- Applications include weather forecasting, molecular modeling, financial modeling, and more.

## HPC at Rutgers University 

At Rutgers, the primary HPC resources are governed by the [Rutgers Office of Advanced Research and Computing (OARC)](https://sites.google.com/view/cluster-user-guide/amarel/welcome?authuser=0). They provide significant online and synchronous (in person) resources for HPC, along with training in batch submission, programming languages, parallel programming, distributed systems, and HPC architectures.

# History of High-Performance Computing

## Early Beginnings

**1940s-1950s**: The origins of HPC can be traced back to the development of early computers, such as the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) and UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer).

![](hpc/Univac_I_Census_dedication.jpg){width=46%}

Used for military (cracking Nazi codes) and scientific purposes, including calculations for atomic bomb development and weather forecasting.

## Emergence of Supercomputers

**1960s-1970s**: The concept of supercomputers emerged with machines like the CDC 6600 and Cray-1.

![](hpc/Science_Museum_20180227_132902_(49362732462).jpg){width=40%}

These systems introduced vector processing and specialized architectures optimized for scientific and engineering applications.

## Parallel Processing and Clusters

**Seymore Cray** was an American electrical engineer and supercomputer architect who designed a series of computers that were the fastest in the world for decades, and founded __Cray Research__ which built many of these machines. He is often called "the father of supercomputing," and has been credited with creating the supercomputer industry.

\vskip .1 in
However, Cray resisted the massively parallel solution to high-speed computing, offering a variety of reasons that it would never work as well as one very fast processor. He famously quipped "If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use: two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?"

## Parallel Processing and Clusters
**1980s-1990s**: During the speed in supercomputers was primarily achieved through two mechanisms:

- **Vector processors:** these were designed using a pipeline architecture to rapidly perform a single floating point operation on a large amount of data. Achieving high performance depended on data arriving in the processing unit in an uninterrupted stream.
- **Shared memory multiprocessing:** a small number (up to 8) processors with access to the same memory space. Interprocess communication took place via the shared memory.

## Parallel Processing and Clusters
**1980s-1990s**:Parallel processing became a key focus in HPC, leading to the development of massively parallel supercomputers like the Connection Machine and Thinking Machines CM-5.

- Clusters of commodity hardware also gained popularity due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability.
- Memory contention was a major impediment to increasing speed; the vector processors required high-speed access to memory but multiple processors working simultaneously created contention for memory that reduced access speed.
- Vector processing worked well with 4 or 8 processors, but memory contention would prevent a 64 or 128 processor machine from working efficiently.

## Evolution of HPC Architectures

- **2000s-Present**: HPC architectures continue to evolve with the rise of multi-core processors, accelerators (e.g., GPUs), and specialized interconnects. Most unviversities develop their own HPC resources.

# Introduction to Cluster Batch Job Scheduling with SLURM

## What is SLURM?

- SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is an open-source job scheduler and resource manager used on many high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
- It allows users to submit, manage, and monitor batch jobs on computing clusters efficiently.

## Key Concepts

1. **Partition**: A partition is a logical grouping of compute nodes with similar hardware characteristics or usage policies.
2. **Job Script**: A job script is a text file containing instructions for the scheduler, including job parameters, resource requests, and executable commands.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Users specify the required resources for their jobs, such as CPUs, memory, and runtime, in the job script.
4. **Job Status**: Users can monitor the status of their submitted jobs, including waiting, running, completed, or failed, using SLURM commands or monitoring tools.

## Submitting a Job with SLURM

1. **Create a Job Script**: Write a job script using a text editor, specifying job parameters and commands.
2. **Submit the Job**: Use the `sbatch` command to submit the job script to SLURM.
3. **Monitor Job Status**: Check the status of the submitted job using commands like `squeue` or monitoring tools provided by SLURM.
4. **Retrieve Results**: Once the job completes, retrieve the results and data generated by the job from the designated output directory.

## Example Job Script
```{bash, eval=F}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4
#SBATCH --mem=8G
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00

# Execute your command here
./my_executable input_file.txt > output_file.txt
```

## Best Practices

- Resource Requests: Specify accurate resource requirements to ensure optimal resource allocation and job performance.
- Job Prioritization: Understand the partition structure and prioritize jobs accordingly to optimize resource utilization.
- Job Dependencies: Use job dependencies to sequence jobs and ensure proper execution order when necessary.
- Error Handling: Include error handling and logging mechanisms in job scripts to facilitate troubleshooting and debugging.

## Conclusion

SLURM is a powerful tool for managing batch job scheduling and resource allocation on cluster computing systems.
By understanding key concepts and following best practices, users can effectively utilize SLURM to submit, manage, and monitor computational tasks on HPC clusters. Explore documentation and seek support from the cluster administrators or user community to learn more about SLURM and optimize your workflow.
