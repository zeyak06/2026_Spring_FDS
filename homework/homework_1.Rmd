## Homework Questions, Part 1: Ethical Considerations (50 points)

**Instructions:** For each of the following questions, provide a thoughtful (but brief) response that demonstrates your understanding of ethical considerations in data science. Your answers should reference relevant principles, frameworks, or real-world examples where applicable. Aim for clarity, directness, and critical thinking. For the examples provided with each question, discuss how they relate to the broader ethical challenges posed by the topic. Be sure to support your arguments with evidence or reasoning, and consider multiple perspectives where appropriate.  

1. How do we address bias in data science models? Example: What steps can be taken to mitigate biases in healthcare AI?
2. What are the limits of informed consent in big data applications? Example: How do we ensure consent is meaningful in large-scale social media data use?
3. How can transparency and interpretability be balanced with complexity? Example: Should there be mandatory explainability for AI systems impacting financial decisions?
4. How should organizations disclose the use of AI tools like ChatGPT?
